                 BGP Route Reflector with Next Hop Self
                      draft-ietf-idr-bgp-fwd-rr-03

Abstract

   The procedures in BGP Route Reflection (RR) spec RFC4456 primarily
   deal with scenarios where the RR is reflecting BGP routes with next
   hop unchanged.  In some deployments like Inter-AS Option C
   (Section 10, RFC4364), the ABRs may perform RR functionality with
   nexthop set to self.  If adequate precautions are not taken, the
   RFC4456 procedures can result in traffic forwarding loop in such
   deployments.

   This document illustrates one such looping scenario, and specifies
   approaches to minimize possiblity of traffic forwarding loop in such
   deployments.  An example with Inter-AS Option C (Section 10, RFC4364)
   deployment is used, where RR with next hop self is used at redundant
   ABRs when they re-advertise BGP transport family routes between
   multiple IGP domains.

   This document illustrates one such looping scenario, and specifies
   approaches to minimize possiblity of traffic forwarding loop in such
   deployments.  An example with Inter-AS Option C (Section 10, RFC4364)
   deployment is used, where RR with next hop self is used at redundant
   ABRs when they re-advertise BGP transport family routes between
   multiple IGP domains.


2.  Terminology

   ABR: Area Border Router

   AS: Autonomous System

   AFI: Address Family Identifier

   BN: Border Node

   EP: Endpoint, e.g. a loopback address in the network

   MPLS: Multi Protocol Label Switching

   PE: Provider Edge

   SAFI: Subsequent Address Family Identifier

2.1.  Definitions and Notations

   Service Family: A BGP address family used for advertising routes for
   destinations in "data traffic".  For example, AFI/SAFIs 1/1 or 1/128.

   Transport Family: A BGP address family used for advertising tunnels,
   which are in turn used by service routes for resolution.  For
   example, BGP LU (AFI/SAFI : 1/4) or BGP CT (AFI/SAFI : 1/76).

   Transport Tunnel : A tunnel over which a service may place traffic.
   Such a tunnel can be provisioned or signaled using a variety of
   means.  For example, Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE), UDP, LDP,
   RSVP-TE, IGP FLEX-ALGO or SRTE.

   Tunnel Route: A Route to Tunnel Destination/Endpoint that is
   installed at the headend (ingress) of the tunnel.

   Tunnel Domain: A domain of the network under a single administrative
   control, containing transport tunnels between Service Nodes (SNs) and
   Border Nodes (BNs).

203.0.113.41  ------------ Traffic Direction ---------->  203.0.113.31

   Figure 1: Reference Topology: Inter-domain BGP Transport Network

      This topology shows an Inter-AS option C (Section 10, [RFC4364])
      provider MPLS network that consists of two ASes, AS1 and AS2.
      They are serving customer networks AS3, AS4 respectively.  Traffic
      direction being described is CE41 to CE31.

      AS2 is further divided into two regions.  There are three tunnel
      domains in provider's network: The two regions in AS2 use RSVP
      intra-domain tunnel.  AS1 also uses RSVP-TE intra-domain tunnels.
      MPLS forwarding is used within these domains and on inter-domain
      links.  BGP LU (AFI/SAFI: 1/4) is the transport family providing
      reachability between PE loopbacks PE25 and PE11.

      Forwarding of PE25 to PE11 BGP LU traffic in AS2 region-2 is the
      focus of this discussion.

      The following RSVP-TE tunnels exist in region-2.

      -  ABR23_to_ASBR21 - metric 40

      -  ABR23_to_ASBR22 - metric 30

      -  ABR24_to_ASBR21 - metric 40

      -  ABR24_to_ASBR22 - metric 30

      -  ABR23_to_ABR24 - metric 30

      -  ABR24_to_ABR23 - metric 30

      The Router-ID of ASBR21 is better than ASBR22 from perspective of
      the BGP path selection.

      The problem is that the pair of redundant ABRs (ABR23, ABR24 in
      Figure 1), each acting as an RR with next hop self, may choose
      each other as best path towards egress PE11, instead of the
      upstream ASBR (ASBR21 or ASBR22), causing a traffic forwarding
      loop.

      This happens because of following the path selection rule
      specified in Section 9 of BGP RR [RFC4456] that tie-breaks on
      ORIGINATOR_ID before CLUSTER_LIST.  RFC4456 considers pure RR
      functionality which leaves next hop unchanged.

      This problem is more probable to happen for routes of BGP
      transport address families in Inter-AS Option C (Section 10
      [RFC4364]) networks, like BGP LU (1/4 or 2/4) and BGP CT (AFI/
      SAFIs: 1/76 or 2/76), because the ABRs perform RR with nexthop
      self functionality for these families.

      Summarising, the necessary conditions for this problem are:

      -  Redundant ABRs perform RR with nexthop self

      -  The redundant ABRs using distinct CLUSTER_ID

      -  Addpath send enabled in Region 1, from RR26 to the redundant
         ABRs ABR23, ABR24

      -  ABR23, ABR24 using per-prefix label allocation mode for the
         transport layered families.

      -  IGP metric situations in Region 2, as explained above.

      -  Existance of Inter-ABR tunnels.

      -  RFC4456 tie-breaks on ORIGINATOR_ID before CLUSTER_LIST

      -  Router-ID values for upstream ASBRs.

4.  Solution Approaches

   Using one or more of the following approaches softens the possibility
   of such loops in an Inter-AS Option C network with redundant ABRs.
   These approaches manage one of the above necessary conditions.

4.1.  Using Same Cluster ID at the ABRs

   Configuring the same CLUSTER_ID at the redundant ABR nodes.

   CLUSTER_ID Loop check will make routes reflected by an ABR unusable
   at the redundant ABRs.

   This approach provides a stable way to avoid this loop, and is not
   affected by network churn.

   However this approach does not allow the ABR-ABR tunnels to be used
   as backup path, in the event where an ABR looses all tunnels to
   upstream ASBR.

4.2.  Using IGP Metric Management

   Assign IGP metrics, such that "ABR to redundant ABR" cost is inferior
   to "ABR to upstream ASBR" cost.

   Then 'IGP metric' based tie-breaker will make an ABR chose the ASBRs
   as best path, instead of redundant ABR.

   Since IGP metrics may change during network churn caused by events
   like link down, this approach needs careful planning to handle all
   possible IGP metric change scenarios.  Debugging any loops caused by
   such transient situations may be much harder.

   This approach allows using the ABR-ABR tunnels to be used as backup
   path, in the event where an ABR looses reachability to upstream ASBR.
   But there is a possibility of transient forwarding loop until BGP
   withdrawals are received, in situations where the redundant ABRs
   simultanously loose tunnel to upstream ASBR (like upstream ASBR
   failure event).  Some mechanism like the one described in [MNH] Sec
   A.9 may be needed to handle the transient forwarding loop problem.

4.3.  Using AIGP Cost Management

   Using AIGP Cost in the network accumulates the IGP metric at "each
   next hop self" re-advertisement.  This provides a better accumulated
   metric for the path.

   Then 'AIGP cost' based tie-breaker will make an ABR chose the ASBRs
   as best path, instead of redundant ABR.

   This approach also needs careful IGP metric planning because it
   depends on the underlying IGP metric view of each node.

   However this approach allows using the ABR-ABR tunnels to be used as
   backup path, in the event where an ABR looses all tunnels to upstream
   ASBR.

   This approach allows using the ABR-ABR tunnels to be used as backup
   path, in the event where an ABR looses reachability to upstream ASBR.
   But there is a possibility of transient forwarding loop until BGP
   withdrawals are received, in situations where the redundant ABRs
   simultanously loose tunnel to upstream ASBR (like upstream ASBR
   failure event).  Some mechanism like the one described in MNH Sec A.9
   may be needed to handle the transient forwarding loop problem.

4.4.  Using BGP CT Management

   In a BGP CT network, using procedures described in [BGP-CT] , tunnels
   belonging to a certain Transport Class (TC) may not be provisioned
   between the redundant ABRs, or may not be included in the customized
   Resolution Scheme used to resolve BGP CT routes with that TC.

   This will ensure that the BGP CT route received with redundant ABR as
   next hop will be Unusable at the receiving ABR, because it will fail
   resolving the next hop.

   This approach needs Transport Class and Resolution Scheme planning in
   the BGP CT network, and provides a stable way to avoid this loop, and
   is not affected by network churn.

   However this approach does not allow the ABR-ABR TC tunnels to be
   used as backup path, in the event where an ABR looses all tunnels for
   that TC to upstream ASBR.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no new requests of IANA.

6.  Security Considerations

   This document does not change the underlying security issues inherent
   in the existing BGP protocol, such as those described in [RFC4271],
   [RFC4272] and [RFC4456].

   Mehanisms described in this document reduce possibility of loops
   within an IBGP domain.  They do not affect routing across EBGP
   sessions.
