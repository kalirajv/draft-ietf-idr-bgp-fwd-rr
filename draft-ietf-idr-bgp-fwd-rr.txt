                 BGP Route Reflector in Forwarding Path
                   draft-ietf-idr-bgp-pathsel-fwd-rr

Abstract

   The procedures in BGP Route Reflection (RR) spec [RFC4456] primarily
   deal with scenarios where the RR is not in forwarding path, and is
   reflecting BGP routes with next hop unchanged.

   These procedures can sometimes result in traffic forwarding loops in
   deployments where the RR is in forwarding path, and is reflecting BGP
   routes with next hop set to self.

   This document specifies approaches to minimize possiblity of such
   traffic forwarding loops.  One of those approaches updates path
   selection procedures specified in Section 9 of BGP RR.  [RFC4456]

Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 RFC 2119 [RFC2119] RFC 8174 [RFC8174] when, and only when, they
   appear in all capitals, as shown here.

     Figure 1: Reference Topology: Inter-domain BGP Transport Network

      A pair of redundant ABRs (ABR23, ABR24 in Figure 1), each acting
      as an RR with next hop self, may choose each other as best path
      towards egress PE11, instead of the upstream ASBR (ASBR21 or
      ASBR22), causing a traffic forwarding loop.

      This happens because of following the path selection rule
      specified in Section 9 of BGP RR [RFC4456] that tie-breaks on
      ORIGINATOR_ID before CLUSTER_LIST.  RFC4456 considers pure RR
      functionality which is not in forwarding path.  When a RR is in
      forwarding path and reflects routes with next hop self, as is the
      case for ABR BNs in a BGP transport network, this rule may cause
      loops.

      This problem can happen for routes of any BGP address family,
      including BGP LU (1/4 or 2/4) and BGP CT (AFI/SAFIs: 1/76 or
      2/76).

      Using one or more of the following approaches softens the
      possibility of such loops in a network with redundant ABRs.

3.1.  Path selection change

      Implementations SHOULD provide a way to alter the tie-breaking
      rule specified in Section 9 of BGP RR [RFC4456] so as to tie-break
      on CLUSTER_LIST step before ORIGINATOR_ID step, when performing
      path selection for BGP routes.

      This document suggests the following modification to the BGP
      Decision Process Tie Breaking rules (Section 9.1.2.2 of [RFC4271])
      that can be applied to path selection of BGP routes:

      The following rule SHOULD be inserted between Steps e) and f): a
      BGP Speaker SHOULD prefer a route with the shorter CLUSTER_LIST
      length.  The CLUSTER_LIST length is zero if a route does not carry
      the CLUSTER_LIST attribute.

3.2.  Other mechanisms

      Taking into account some other deployment considerations can also
      help in avoiding this problem, e.g.,:

      -  IGP metric should be assigned such that "ABR to redundant ABR"
         cost is inferior to "ABR to upstream ASBR" cost.

      -  Using procedures described in [BGP-CT] , tunnels belonging to
         non 'best effort' Transport Classes SHOULD NOT be provisioned
         between ABRs.  This will ensure that the BGP CT route received
         from an ABR with next hop self will not be usable at a
         redundant ABR.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no new requests of IANA.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document does not change the underlying security issues inherent
   in the existing BGP protocol, such as those described in [RFC4271],
   [RFC4272] and [RFC4456].

A.1.  Document History

   The content in this document was introduced as part of [BGP-CT].  But
   because the described problem is not specific to BGP CT and is useful
   for other BGP families also, it is being extracted out to this
   separate document.
